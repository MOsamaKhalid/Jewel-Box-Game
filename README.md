# Jewel-Box-Game

There are six jewel boxes numbered 1 to 6. Each jewel box has a different password hardcoded in the program. 
Design a game in which program rolls a dice on behalf of user with numbers from one to six. Based on the dice 
value, unlock one of the jewel boxes asking the user to enter password assigned to that jewel box. If the password 
entered matches with the hardcoded one than call function "ChangePwd" which takes the jewel box number and its password. 
Functions uses reference arguments to represent password. Function changes the password and print "Password Changed" on 
the console. Function also keeps record of number of times password been changed.
